I am a Ph.D. student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Rumi Chunara](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/rumi-chunara). I am a member of [ChunaraLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/chunaralab/) and [ViDA](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/). I am broadly interested in developing fair probabilistic methods in causal inference and domain adaptation with specific applications in healthcare. 

Previously, I obtained my Masters degree in Computer Science from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), where [Prof. Rumi Chunara](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/rumi-chunara) supervised my Master's thesis. My fateful but interesting past was spent dabbling in Computer Engineering at Pune Institute of Computer Engineering.
