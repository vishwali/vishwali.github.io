I am a Ph.D. student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Rumi Chunara](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/rumi-chunara). I am a member of [ChunaraLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/chunaralab/) and [ViDA](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/). I am broadly interested in developing fair probabilistic methods in causal inference and domain adaptation with specific applications in healthcare and public health. Overall my research aims to develop methods for advancing health equity while learning from multiple environments. My research is generously supported by the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/).

Previously, I obtained my Masters degree in Computer Science from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), where [Prof. Rumi Chunara](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/rumi-chunara) supervised my Master's thesis. My fateful but interesting past was spent dabbling in Computer Engineering at Pune Institute of Computer Engineering.
